              chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, played by
              two opponents on a checkered board with specially designed pieces
              of contrasting colours, commonly white and black. White moves
              first, after which the players alternate turns in accordance with
              fixed rules, each player attempting to force the opponent’s
              principal piece, the King, into checkmate—a position where it is
              unable to avoid capture. Chess first appeared in India about the
              6th century AD and by the 10th century had spread from Asia to the
              Middle East and Europe. Since at least the 15th century, chess has
              been known as the “royal game” because of its popularity among the
              nobility. Rules and set design slowly evolved until both reached
              today’s standard in the early 19th century. Once an intellectual
              diversion favoured by the upper classes, chess went through an
              explosive growth in interest during the 20th century as
              professional and state-sponsored players competed for an
              officially recognized world championship title and increasingly
              lucrative tournament prizes. Organized chess tournaments, postal
              correspondence games, and Internet chess now attract men, women,
              and children around the world. This article provides an in-depth
              review of the history and the theory of the game by noted author
              and international grandmaster Andrew Soltis. For a chronological
              list of world champions since the mid-19th century, featuring
              direct links to biographical articles, see the table of world
              chess champions. Chess is played on a board of 64 squares arranged
              in eight vertical rows called files and eight horizontal rows
              called ranks. These squares alternate between two colours: one
              light, such as white, beige, or yellow; and the other dark, such
              as black or green. The board is set between the two opponents so
              that each player has a light-coloured square at the right-hand
              corner.
