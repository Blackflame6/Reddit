          <h2>What does a mid-level fullstack portfolio look like?</h2>

              I'd really hope to never be on a team with most of the other
              people commenting here. Hard truth: compassion and guidance are
              more valuable in interacting with other developers, especially
              newer developers than punching down - I'd hate to see how most of
              you here must treat people under you I guess it's easy to forget
              you were new at this once too. Anyway OP - there's truth to those
              comments I'm as far as your there's more to job readiness than
              your - however it would have been nice for some of them to answer
              your questions as rather than try and shoot you down. It's
              courageous of you to reach out when you are feeling unsure of
              something regarding your skills and career, and to even ben taking
              this on on your own - trust that these responses are NOT the only
              measure or reflection of your progress. That being said - without
              facing some of the curve balls and unknowns it would be really
              hard to prove yourself as a mid-level now. I think you could shoot
              for an entry level role now. First jobs are the hardest to land
              though you might want to keep learning while applying. That being
              said once you land something you show every sign up of growing to
              mid and beyond quickly - self driven, willing to put yourself out
              there, willing to ask questions on what you might be missing and
              taking the initiative to fill in those blanks. In my experience
              portfolios don't matter much - they help but not critical. Most
              developers are working for companies building particular features
              - being able to point to those things in the wild is cool, but
              usually the company owns that code so you can't self host and show
              that code anyway. But you do want to be able to speak on what you
              know well and what your challenges have been. More places are
              testing on some form of Data Structures and Algorithms even if the
              role doesn't require a deep understanding of them. If you have
              trouble landing a role an internship will prove that other people
              have already shown faith in you and your work - that can go a long
              way too. You may want to consider being open to frontend or
              backend focused roles too. If you have more questions feel free to
              dm me. I'd be happy to go into more specifics with you
